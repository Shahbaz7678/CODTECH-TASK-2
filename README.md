## Overview of the Project

### **Project** : Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression


### Objective 
The objective of this project is to predict the results for dependent variables using simple linear regression model. The project further visualises the results.

### Key Activities 
1. Data Exploration and Pre-Processing: Collecting the data and understanding the different parameters of the data and finding valuable trends and distributions.
2. Splitting the Dataset: Splitting the dataset into training and testing datasets.
3. Modeling and Predicting: Implement the required model on the datasets and predict the results.
4. Error Calculation: Estimate the errors in the prediction.
5. Visualisation: Visualise the outputs.

### Technologies Used 
1. Python: The primary programming language for data analysis
2. pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis
3. matplotlib: For creating visualisations
4. seaborn: Used for creating graphics that are informative and attractive
5. sklearn: Used to implement statistical models
